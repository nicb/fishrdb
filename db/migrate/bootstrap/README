To convert from Access data (Maria-Elena and Fabrizio's databases):

- running 'make' should do it

- however, this process relies in the following assumptions:

  - there must be three Access files in the data/access directory:

    ARCHIVIO MUSICA ALTRI AUTORI.mdb, ARCHIVIO MUSICA GS.mdb,
	SERIE DATABASE.mdb

	(that's what the dump_access.sh script does)

  - these files need to be converted into .sql statements, but before doing
	that

  - they need to be cleansed (that's what the ./cleanse-data.rb script does)

  - and then they can be inserted into the new fishrdb database

- so, if things go wrong you should check (through the Makefile) that all
  files get created properly and that the cleanse function in the
  cleanse-data.rb does all the cleansing required

- we do everything for the development database, but *NOT* for the
  production  database  (to  make  sure  we  don't   scratch   something
  important). The test database is always built from scratch so we don't
  do anything there.
