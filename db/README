The .sql files in this directory are out of date. They are needed by the
bootstrap  procedures,  which  are  never  done  any  longer  since  the
production  database  has  evolved  since  bootstrapping  it.  The  only
authoritative up-to-date source on the status of  the  database  is  the
schema.rb file.
