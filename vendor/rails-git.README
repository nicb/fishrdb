======= NOTE: this README is OBSOLETE! ========

We now have a rake task and a library that do all the nitty-gritty.

To install:

rake fishrdb:install (RAILS_ENV is by default 'production')

To uninstall:

rake fishrdb:uninstall

also, the rails framework is now saved into svn, so there's no need to install
it/deinstall it.

=== The old notes below are kept just for history documentation ===

To pull out the git rails repository:

git clone git://github.com/rails/rails.git

and then:

cd rails
git checkout <selected version tag>

(as in git checkout v2.1.0, for example)

all plugins should be pulled out with

ruby script/plugin install <plugin_name>

On Wed Jul  9 15:02:18 CEST 2008, plugins are:

acts_as_list
acts_as_tree
auto_complete
enum-column
will_paginate

(will_paginate is broken, as of rails 2.2.0, in the normal installation;
it should be installed with
ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/mislav/will_paginate.git,
while enum-column is still under svn)
